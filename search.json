    "text": "About dataset\nStatistics Poland conducts a survey of accommodation establishments with 10 or more bed-places:\n\nMandatory survey on monthly base.\nCensus survey of approx. 15 ths. of establishments.\nThe deadline for submitting reports is the 10th day after the reporting month. In practice, establishments report throughout the entire month.\nUnit response rate is approximately 80% and varies due to seasonality.\nItem non-response pertains mostly to foreign tourist data.\n\nThe survey covers tourist accommodation establishments regardless of the type, owner, and location, as well as establishments with other purposes (not related to tourism) that are temporarily used by tourists (e.g., student dormitories, sports and recreation centers).\nTourist accommodation establishments classified into the following activity groups according to NACE Rev. 2 classification:\n\n55.1 – hotels and similar accommodation,\n55.2 – holiday and other short-stay accommodation,\n55.3 – camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks.\n\nThe study covers 20 types of tourist accommodation establishments. Data is collected with “Report on the occupancy of tourist accommodation establishments”:\n\n\nProblem statement\nDue to variety of booking systems, accommodation establishments report their data with different timeliness. In such case, early imputation can be used for flash estimates of statistics of accommodation establishments.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC-BY 4.0",
