# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that enhance the performance of machine learning models. In this chapter, the emphasis is put on feature creation and feature selection. Feature creation refers to deriving new variables using domain expertise or by detecting patterns within the data, while feature selection focuses on identifying and retaining the most relevant subset of features for analysis.
